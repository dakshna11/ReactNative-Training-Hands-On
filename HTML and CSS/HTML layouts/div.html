        <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] 
            JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, 
            dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
            [11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating 
            third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, 
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
